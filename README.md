### Implementimng House Price problem using Gradient Descent Aprroach

I have implemented the Algorithm using just the equations as it will highlight you how the agorithms performs on basis of your text reading.
First of all I will take the Dataset and will normalise it to a given standard,as it is necessary otherwise it have to make huge calculations and wil consume system memory,so i have normalize it between -3 and +3 and after that i have used Gradient Descent which involves cost function and updation of Hypothesis to get the desired result.

You can see that cost Function has tend to zero over the iterations which means our model has been fit according to the Data, and we can therefore take that Hypothesis.
